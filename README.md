# Date-A-Scientist-Machine-Learning-Project

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that weâ€™ve never had before about how different people experience romance.
In this capstone, we will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.
